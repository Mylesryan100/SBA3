[The challenge](#the-challenge)
 3. Any challenges faced during implementation and how they were addressed.
 
 some challenges I faced during implementation is typos in Tailwind. I thought the lowercase L was was number 1 which caused a lot of headache and confusion in my code. I also forgot to put to correct prefixes for my background color syntaxes. For example I wrote [var(--brand-purple)] instead of bg-[var(--brand-purple)].


  Reflection
  Write a brief reflection (100-200 words) discussing: Challenges you encountered during the project. Your approach to solving these challenges. Improvements you would make if given more time.

  One challenge I faced that I found really frustrating during this project was finding and dealing with small typo errors in Tailwind classes like writing max-w-7xl instead of max-w-7xl. I didn't realize the L was a lowercase L at first and just assumed it was a number  one. these errors completely broke the layout of my Bento Grid and made me realize that I need to more cautious with my spelling and class names. Their were a lot of color contrast issues in particular that I noticed like pairing dark purple with black text. My solution for this problem was to use Custom CSS variable so I could acheive lighter and easier to see brand and overrall make my Bento Grid more accessible in the long run.
